                <h1 class="fw-bolder">Top 5 Taylor Swift Eras</h1>
                <p class="lead">Taylor Swift's <em>Eras Tour</em> has proven to be a great sucess, both for her fans and general audiences. In ten sections, Taylor takes her audience through over a decade of music. But some, like myself, have their favorite eras. Below, I will be showing my own ranking.</p>
                <a class="btn btn-lg btn-light" href="#No. 5"> 1, 2, 3, Let's Go, Bitch!</a>
            </div>
            
        </section>
        <section class="bg-light" id="No. 5">
            <div class="container px-4">
                <div class="row gx-4 justify-content-center">
                    <div class="col-lg-8">
                        <h2 class="Midnights">Number 5: Midnights</h2>
                        <p class="lead"> In 5th place is <em> Midnights</em>, which at the time of writing is the most recent non-rerecording from Taylor Swift. (In less than a month, <em>The Tortured Poets Department</em> will be released, less than two years after <em>Midnights.</em>) The songs in this section of the show are:</p>
                        <ul class="Midnights">
                            <li> Lavender Haze </li>
                               <li>Anti‚ÄêHero </li>
                               <li>Midnight Rain </li>
                              <li> Vigilante Shit </li>
                                <li>Bejeweled </li>
                                <li>Mastermind </li>
                               <li> Karma </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="lead">When I went to see <em>The Eras Tour</em>, Ice Spice appeared during the final number. While I like all these songs, making this set the last of the night was just a bit too overwhelming for me.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-lg-4">

                    <div class="col-lg-8">
                        <h2 class="Red">Number 4: Red</h2>
                        <p class="lead">Next up is Red, first released in 2012, and re-released in 2022. The songs in this set include:</p>
                        <ul class="Red">
                            <li> 22 </li>
                               <li>We are Never Ever Getting Back Together </li>
                               <li>I Knew You Were Trouble </li>
                              <li> Nothing New </li>
                                <li>All Too Well (10 Minute Version) </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="lead">These songs are some of the most nostalgic for me in the Eras Tour, since I was pretty young when the original album came out and it has been a mainstay in my life. While not part of this set, one of the suprise songs when I saw the show was from <em>Red</em>, and that song (<em>Holy Ground</em>) is one of my favorites from the album. While <em>All Too Well</em> drags on sometimes, it is a magical thing to experience with others.</p>

                        <h2 class="Folklore">Number 3: Folklore</h2>
                        <p class="lead">In third place is <em>Folklore</em>, the first of two pandemic-era albums. <em>Folklore</em> is defined by woodsy visuals and its fictional characters, a first for Taylor Swift's albums. The songs in this setlist are:</p>
                        <ul class="Folklore">
                            <li>The 1</li>
                                <li>Betty</li>
                                <li>The Last Great American Dynasty</li>
                                <li>August</li>
                                <li>Illicit Affairs </li>
                                <li>My Tears Ricochet </li>
                              <li>Cardigan</li>
                              </ul>
                            <p class="lead">These songs were great to hear live, since they had never been performed live before the Eras Tour. I especially loved <em>August</em>, and it was really amazing to see it live.</p>

                                <p class="caption"> <br> The <em>Folklore</em> set had some changes, including switching out "Invisible String" for "The 1."</p>

                    <div class="col-lg-8">
                        <h2 class="Fearless">Number 2: Fearless</h2>
                        <p class="lead">This album is my favorite out of all 11, which honestly is the reason this set is so high up. <em>You Belong with Me</em> was such a formative song in my childhood, and I am a bit sad that the original album is no longer in vogue. The songs on this portion of the setlist are:</p>
                        <ul class="Fearless">
                            <li>Fearless
                        <li>You Belong with Me </li>
                        <li>Love Story</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="lead"> I am more than a little disappointed that this set is so short, though it is not the shortest set of the night. <em>Speak Now</em> only has one song, which is one of many reasons that era did not make my top five. The three songs that Taylor sings for the <em>Fearless</em> set are some of her most sing-able, which makes this early set a really fun time.</p>
                    </div>

                        <h2 class="Lover"> Number 1: Lover</h2>
                        <p class="lead">She's Miss Americana, after all. <em>Lover</em>, the first of Taylor's albums with Republic Records, was also the first of her albums not to get a tour since the initial debut album (also called <em>Taylor Swift</em>!) Thus, she knew she had to make a splash with this album's setlist. And a splash she did make! The <em>Lover</em> setlist includes:</p>
                        <ul class="Lover">
                            <li>Miss Americana &amp; the Heartbreak Prince </li>
                                <li>Cruel Summer </li>
                                <li>The Man</li>
                                <li>You Need to Calm Down </li>
                                <li>Lover</li>
                                <li>The Archer</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="lead">This era opens the concert, which was a surprise when I first read about the setlist. However, I think <em>Miss Americana &amp; the Heartbreak Prince</em> is a great opener. <em>Cruel Summer</em> is a fan favorite, for good reason. I only wish that my favorite song from the album, <em>Paper Rings</em>, made the setlist.</p>
